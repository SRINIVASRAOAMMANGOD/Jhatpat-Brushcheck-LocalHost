# Jhatpat BrushCheck üéØ


## Basic Details
Jhatpat BrushCheck is a lightweight, pre-trained AI-powered web application designed to help users quickly check the condition of their toothbrushes. With just a simple photo upload or webcam capture, the app classifies the toothbrush into one of four categories: New, Used, Dirty, or Frayed. It also provides an estimated bacteria level on the toothbrush which is not accurate .

### Project Description
Jhatpat BrushCheck lets you quickly check your toothbrush‚Äôs condition with a simple photo. Using pretrained model, it tells you if your brush is new, used, dirty, or frayed ‚Äî plus an estimate of bacteria level. Keep your smile fresh with this fast and fun tool!


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People often ignore their toothbrush condition until it‚Äôs too late ‚Äî risking yucky bacteria and bad breath!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A quick, quirky web app that judges your toothbrush for you! Upload a photo and get instant feedback, so you never let your brush go bad unnoticed.
