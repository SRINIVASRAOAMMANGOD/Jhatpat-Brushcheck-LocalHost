# Jhatpat BrushChecküéØ


## Basic Details
Jhatpat BrushCheck is a lightweight, AI-powered web application designed to help users quickly check the condition of their toothbrushes. With just a simple photo upload or webcam capture, the app classifies the toothbrush into one of four categories: New, Used, Dirty, or Frayed. It also provides an estimated bacteria level on the toothbrush, helping users understand when it's time to replace their brush for better oral hygiene.

The goal of Jhatpat BrushCheck is to promote better dental care by making it easy and fun for everyone to monitor their toothbrush condition regularly ‚Äî without any technical hassle.
